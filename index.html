                    Hello and welcome to my homepage! 
                    <br>My name is Ekaterina but I go by Katya because, letâ€™s face it, not many people can pronounce
                    my full name. In April of 2018, I joined The Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin in hopes of eventually developing a solid skillset 
                    to become a successful web developer. 
                    I was born in Khabarovsk which is the second largest city in the Russian Far East. As a college junior, I moved to Anchorage, 
                    Alaska where I graduated from the University of Alaska, Anchorage. A few years ago, my husband and I moved to Austin in search
                     of new adventures and city life. We both absolutely love it here!
                     <br>
                    My background is in Business Administration and Oil & Gas Procurement. I did not have any coding experience before joining the 
                    bootcamp; but I am confident that by the end of the program I will be ready to enter the workforce. I know it will be challenging 
                    and stressful at times but I am excited to learn and I cannot wait to start a new career as a full stack web developer.
